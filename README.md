# fancontrol-extended
Fancontrol script with support for module-based monitoring. Designed to solve the unreliable order of module loading of lm_sensors, that will arbitrarialy change the "hwmon"s number from boot to boot.

## How to use
Copy your /etc/fancontrol file to /etc/fancontrol-extended, replace the "hwmon"s with the actual name of the modules, and add a `MODULES` variable, containing the modules used to monitor.
Example:

    # Configuration file generated by pwmconfig, changes will be lost
    INTERVAL=10
    MODULES=k10temp it8728
    FCTEMPS= it8728/device/pwm1=k10temp/temp1_input
    FCFANS= it8728/device/pwm1=it8728/device/fan1_input
    MINTEMP= it8728/device/pwm1=30
    MAXTEMP= it8728/device/pwm1=70
    MINSTART= it8728/device/pwm1=150
    MINSTOP= it8728/device/pwm1=0

Then run ./fancontrol-extended
